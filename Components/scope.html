            <p>Internet of Every‑Nano Things (IoNT) divined to be a heterogeneous network of nanoscale non-biological and biological machines named as Every‑Nano Things (NTs), communicating through conventional means, e.g., tera-Hertz communication and non‑conventional means, e.g., molecular communications (MC). This communication can be in macro environments, e.g., open space or micro environments, e.g., inside human body. The immediate intent of above-mentioned emerging technologies pay the way for direct and seamless interaction with biological systems for precise sensing and control of their dynamics in actual time. However, to unleash the potential of IoNT, there are substantial challenges to be addressed. These challenges create the foundation for several opportunities in the context of communication aspects of IoNT. Moreover, any current communication technologies that can be applied to IoNT devices have to be researched and promoted. These range from developing feasible nano communication and energy harvesting techniques for NTs to handling the big data generated by IoNT. Also, to obtain the feasibility of interaction between the biological and non-biological devices in heterogenous networks is one the critical aspects. Due to these reasons, through this workshop, we aim to find and promote new communication solutions for IoNT applications.</p>
